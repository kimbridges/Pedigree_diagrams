# Pedigree_diagrams
Mostly wrappers for code that makes it simple to build small pedigree diagrams.

## Examples
* Furumoto: Small diagrams that show the relationships between different parts of this extended family.
* Kinship_Visualization: A broader discussion and examples that show quite a bit of variation available (e.g., colors, symbol shapes).
